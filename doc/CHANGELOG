    Reed-Solomon. Reference paper: 

        Dimitris S. Papailiopoulos, Jianqiang Luo, Alexandros G. Dimakis,
        Cheng Huang, Jin Li, "Simple Regenerating Codes: Network Coding for
        Cloud Storage", INFOCOM 2012.  

	The original implementation of SRC is contributed by Sarabjot Khangura and
	Alex Dimakis at USC. 

Version 1.1.0 (Oct 28, 2011)
  - Support large chunk size that is a multiple of 4KB. Note that we do not
    support some file sizes for a file being written to NCFS. Please refer to
    the user guide for details.
  - The configuration is now stored in XML format.
  - A standalone recovery utility is now used to support the recovery
    operation. See the user guide for details.
  - Bugs have been fixed.

Version 1.0.2 (Jun 27, 2011)
  - Implement two new codes: (i) Reed-Solomon for general n and k, and (ii)
    E-MBR for general n and k.  Both codes are built on the Jerasure library
    by James S. Plank.  For completeness and compilation purposes, we include
    the Jerasure library in our source code distribution. 
    
    The Jerasure library is available on 
    http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/papers/CS-08-627.html.
